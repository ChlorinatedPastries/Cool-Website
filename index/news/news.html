   <h1>The move to Linux</h1>
    <p id="linux">Hello world! you've propably noticed the fact that their havent been alot of commmits lately.
      And thats because i've moved to Linux. Why you ask? because my GPU just died randomly and I had to get  a new one.
      and also got a new power supply to go with it and a new NVME ssd. the next time i booted up my computer it just wouldnt boot up in to windows 
      So I found a USB drive w/ Ubuntu, so than I intalled it and got steam (most important) and put my pc on a all nighter to download all the games.
      the next morning I whent to the app center and got vs code and the brave browser. than I needed an art program bc (this is crazy) you cant run MS paint in linux.(crazy)
      to at random I picked in the app center Krita (still geting used to) and GNU image manipulation program bc why not. next I hade to get GitHub desktop but its not in the app center!
      so I serched it up and found some github repo that had the intaller, and Boom! Now am 80% set up to game and code! 
      all so got Hexchat bc it could be useful if i manage to get a IRC server running on the site.
