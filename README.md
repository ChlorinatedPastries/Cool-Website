Here at the Some People Team we are making a gamesite to help EVERYONE get past the barriers (ie: blockers, enterprise enrollment, text filltering, and many more!) ment to <s>"protect from the online world"</s> get rid of fun and our F  R  E  E  D  O  M â„¢!

We are also here to show that it is in fact posabale to make a gamesite without ads, fanse CSS, and trackers!

<!--Note 1 We are looking for developers! If you want to help us make the site plheas fill out this form! <a herf=""> -->

Note: this gamesite is focused on Chromebooks so if we could get sombody that knows windows and/or linux that would be very good!
