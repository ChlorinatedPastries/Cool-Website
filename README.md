If you fork my site pls credit me somewhere!

Here at the Some People Team we are making a gamesite to help EVERYONE (Not just students in school!) get past barriers (ie: blockers, enterprise enrollment, text filltering, etc.) set by the admins to force students office, workers, or pretty much any one using the internet (that includes you btw.)

We are also here to show that it is in fact possible to make a gamesite without ads, fanse CSS, and any form of online tracking! AND also make it a good site to use! (And have fun)

Also every devloper who helps make this site gets there own devpage to do what ever they want! 

<!--Note 1 We are looking for developers! If you want to help us make the site fill out this form! <a herf="/index/appform/appform.htm"> -->

Note: this gamesite is focused on Chromebooks so if we could get sombody that knows windows and/or linux that would be very good!
